The catalog is a place where you can store templates of mobs and items<BR>for reuse, or for quick global modification and analysis.  Mobs and items in<BR>your catalog can be changed globally simply by creating and then changing any<BR>instance of one of them.  You can create new instances of a cataloged object<BR>simply by entering CREATE &lt;cataloged object name>. Your catalog is keyed by<BR>name, so once the name of a cataloged item or mob is set, it should not be<BR>changed. <BR><BR>You may review the objects in your catalog using the catalog list command. You<BR>can also check the catalog synchronicity of the objects in your live rooms with<BR>scan, or your saved rooms with dbscan.  You can check for uncataloged objects<BR>in live rooms with the overlook parameter, or in your saved rooms with<BR>dboverlook. <BR><BR>You may delete an object from your catalog to stop using it as a global<BR>template. Deleting an object from the catalog only detaches instances of a<BR>cataloged object from all others, but does not destroy any actual instances.<BR><BR>The catalog is also used to manage a global random item-drop table.  Items can<BR>be set to randomly appear in the inventories of selected mobs when those mobs<BR>are brought to life, or at the moment of their death. Use CATALOG EDIT &lt;item<BR>name> to change drop settings.</pre>

			<a name="CMFS"><B>CMFS</B></a>
			<pre>CoffeeMud File System<BR>The CoffeeMud File System is a means of accessing files inside your main<BR>CoffeeMud folder along side files stored in your CoffeeMud database.  Files in<BR>the CMFS can be stored either in the local file system, in CoffeeMud's<BR>database, or in both.  The CMFS sees both sets of files and folders/directories<BR>as if they were part of a single file system.<BR><BR>Normally, the files required for operation of CoffeeMud, such as text files,<BR>class files, help files, images, and other files, are loaded from the<BR>appropriate directories on your LOCAL file system inside the main CoffeeMud<BR>folder.  If you installed CoffeeMud into D:\games\engines\coff, for instance,<BR>the file intro.txt (the intro screen) would be loaded from<BR>D:\games\engines\coff\ resources\text\intro.txt. <BR><BR>Under the CoffeeMud system, however, you should always think of your CoffeeMud<BR>folder as a file system unto itself.  The same file discussed above, even when<BR>referring to the local file system inside CoffeeMud, would be accessed using<BR>the path:  resources/text/intro.txt. You'll notice that the path separators are<BR>forward slashes / like in UNIX, instead of the normal back-slashes \ used in<BR>DOS.  This is the standard for the CMFS.  You'll also notice that the resources<BR>directory is accessed as if it were at the root of its own drive.  This is also<BR>part of the CoffeeMud File System.  Because of this, CoffeeMud is utterly<BR>unable to access any files outside of its installation directory.  Keep this in<BR>mind!<BR><BR>Within this installation directory structure, CoffeeMud is able to store files<BR>both on your local file system drive, and in your database (VFS Files).  The<BR>VFS, or Virtual File System, refers specifically to files and folders which are<BR>saved in your database, and accessible through the MUDGrinder's File Browser,<BR>or the MUD's SHELL command (see HELP SHELL).  When the CoffeeMud directory<BR>structure is viewed through those two screens, files in the CoffeeMud database<BR>and files in the local file system are both viewable as if they were part of a<BR>single file system, the CMFS.<BR><BR>The files referenced in CoffeeMud are case-insensitive, except where dealing<BR>with the local file system, where it may be case-sensitive depending upon your<BR>operating system.  Any filename or path may be preceded by a :: string to<BR>denote forced VFS/database access, or // to denote forced local file-system<BR>access.  When neither is specified for a given file path, the VFS file is<BR>always preferred over the local one. For instance, the path<BR>::resources/text/intro.txt would refer ONLY to a copy of the intro.txt file<BR>stored in the database as a VFS file. If that file is not in the database when<BR>the :: string is used, the file will not be found.  The path<BR>//resources/text/intro.txt would refer ONLY to the copy of the intro.txt file<BR>stored in the local file system, even if the same file appears in the VFS.  The<BR>path resources/text/intro.txt will use the copy of intro.txt stored in the VFS<BR>*if* it exists there, or the one on the local file system otherwise.<BR><BR>The / character is always used to separate directory paths and folders, such as<BR>/resources/text/intro.txt would refer to the file down.txt in the text folder,<BR>which in turn is in the resources folder, which in turn is located in the root<BR>directory.<BR><BR>So, as we've seen, whenever you need to refer to a file in CoffeeMud, you<BR>should keep this system in mind.  Files which are part of your CMFS may be in<BR>the VFS database, or in the local file system.  They may even be in both! This<BR>system provides security for the server in which CoffeeMud is being run, and<BR>provides for the ability to grant folder-level (or even VFS-folder-level)<BR>security to builders and other administrative users.</pre>

This command may also be used to export individual<BR>rooms, player data, or unique items or mobs as well.  If the second parameter<BR>(ITEMS/MOBS/WEAPONS/etc) is NOT specified, export will produce full room data<BR>for the scope of the first parameter (AREA, ROOM, or WORLD). If the second<BR>parameter IS specified, then only the specified data will be generated.<BR>The results will be written to the file given in the last argument, or to the<BR>screen if "screen" is given as the last argument, or sent to your email address<BR>if that is enabled.  The extension need not be included, as coffeemud will add<BR>it if not present.  If a directory name is given (no file name), the system<BR>will reference the AREA ARCHIVE file name for an Area, assuming EXPORT AREA or<BR>EXPORT WORLD is used. The default directory for this command is the CoffeeMud<BR>root.</pre>

			<a name="GENERATE"><B>GENERATE</B></a>
			<pre>Command : GENERATE<BR>Usage   : GENERATE [OBJ TYPE] [ID] (FROM [FILENAME]) ([VAR]=[VAL]...)<BR>([DIRECTION])<BR>Example : generate area maze_dungeon from randareas/example.xml areasize=50<BR>areaname=test level_range=10?20 aggrochance=50 theme=kobolds south<BR>Example : generate string list<BR><BR>This command uses an xml file to generate random content for your mud.  This<BR>content can be anything from whole areas, to rooms, mobs, items, or simple<BR>strings. By default, the content is built from the file in<BR>resources/randareas/example.xml, though the builder may specify his or her own<BR>xml file path as one of the many arguments.  The arguments, briefly, are:<BR><BR>OBJ TYPE: One of the following: AREA, ROOM, MOB, ITEM, or STRING.<BR><BR>ID      : one of the "id" xml attributes defined on any tag in the XML file.<BR>Use GENERATE STRING LIST for a list of all "id" attributes defined in your<BR>file.<BR><BR>FROM "F": An optional argument to specify your own xml file, with the resources<BR>directory being the default root.<BR><BR>VAR=VAL : One or more variables and their definitions.  Many tags will have a<BR>specific set of required variables which must be defined in order for the<BR>content to be generated.  Failing to specify one of the required variables will<BR>cause an error message listing the variables which must be defined, and the<BR>type of data required for the variable.  Variable types which list numbers as<BR>their data types may also have math expressions values (so you can use random<BR>numbers).  See the help on MATH EXPRESSION for more information on this.  In<BR>addition to required variables, you may also use the space to enter one or more<BR>"override" values.  Many object fields (such as LEVEL for mobs and items, or<BR>NAME, etc) as well as the XML id tags, can have their "random" values<BR>overridden by defining them using the generate command.<BR><BR>DIRECTION: This applies only to ROOM and AREA object types.  The object, if<BR>successfully generated, will be linked to the current room that the player is<BR>standing in, in the direction they specify.<BR><BR>In closing, the GENERATE command is an interesting way to deliver large amounts<BR>of dynamic content for your world, though it can never replace the caring touch<BR>of a real, creative builder.  If anyone is interested in writing their own xml<BR>content, please open up the /resources/randareas/example.xml file and begin<BR>reading. Use that file as an example on how to construct your own.</pre>

			<a name="GMODIFY"><B>GMODIFY</B></a>
			<pre>Command : GMODIFY<BR>Usage   : GMODIFY (AREA/ROOM/WORLD) [FIELD=VAL](&&/||[...])<BR>(CHANGE=[FIELD=VAL])<BR>Example : gmodify area class=genmob&&name=the cityguard change=name=the guard<BR>Example : gmodify world class=[cs]GenMob&&name=[ss]city change=name=[ss]<BR>Example : gmodify ?<BR>Short(s): <BR>A command to select objects in a given area, room, or the whole world based on<BR>the specified field values, and optionally change some of those specified<BR>fields.<BR><BR>Searching the entire world is implied, but the first parameter may be the word<BR>AREA or ROOM to narrow the search.  You may also enter WORLD to make the world<BR>search explicit.<BR><BR>The next parameter is the search criteria.  The key phrase WHEN= may optionally<BR>precede it to make explicit that you are specifying the search criteria.  The<BR>search criteria fields may be separated by && strings to specify that all of<BR>the preceding criteria AND the next single criteria must be true.  The criteria<BR>fields may also be separated by || strings to specify that all of the preceding<BR>criteria OR the next single criteria may be true.  One of those strings must be<BR>present when specifying more than one criteria.<BR><BR>Each field in the search criteria must be of the form FIELD=VALUE,<BR>FIELD!=VALUE, FIELD$VALUE, FIELD>VALUE, FIELD&lt;VALUE, FIELD>=VALUE, or<BR>FIELD&lt;=VALUE.  Where FIELD must be a valid search field.  Enter GMODIFY ?<BR>for a complete list of all valid fields.  Not all fields will apply to all<BR>object types, so take this into account especially when using &lt; or !=<BR>operators.  The operators are all normal except for the new one, $, which means<BR>that the value is really a regular expression. The VALUE portion of the<BR>criteria may be prefixed with modifiers, which include: <BR>[ss] to specify that the value refers to a substring of the fields whole value.<BR>[cs] to specify that the search is case sensitive (case insensitive is<BR>implied).<BR><BR>The last parameter is the optional change specifications.  These specifications<BR>must be prefixed with the key phrase CHANGE=.  If these specifications are not<BR>included, GMODIFY will display the results of the search.  The change<BR>specifications are similar to the search criteria in that they consist of<BR>groupings of FIELD=VALUE separated by && strings.  Unlike search criteria,<BR>however, operators other than =, and strings other than || have no special<BR>meaning.  The fields, like in the search criteria, must be valid fields for the<BR>options selected by the search criteria.  The fields on the object will be<BR>changed to the specified value UNLESS the following conditions are met: the<BR>VALUE portion of a field is prefixed with the modifier [ss], and the VALUE<BR>portion of an identical field in the search criteria was also prefixed with the<BR>modifier [ss].  Under those special conditions, instead of substituting the<BR>entire field value on the object with the new value, ONLY the portion of the<BR>string selected in the search criteria will be substituted.</pre>

			<a name="HOLIDAYS"><B>HOLIDAYS</B></a>
			<pre>Holidays are a special/reserved quest defined by file<BR>/resources/quests/holidays/holidays.quest. They are very simple Scriptless<BR>quests that can be started at random intervals, or on certain mud dates, or<BR>real-life dates.  The holidays will only impact the areas specified by the<BR>holiday settings, and only the mobs in those areas specified in the settings,<BR>and only with the features you specify.  Use LIST HOLIDAYS to see a list of all<BR>defined holidays and the areas hey are defined for.  By default, 3 special-case<BR>weather related holidays are included which impact any area that meets their<BR>criteria.  You can use MODIFY HOLIDAY &lt;name> to change the settings for a<BR>holiday, DESTROY HOLIDAY &lt;name> to delete one, or CREATE HOLIDAY name to create<BR>a new one that will automatically apply to the area the creator is standing in.</pre>

The first parameter specifies<BR>whether the items in the text file are to be merged with those in the entire<BR>world, in your current area, or just the room. The second parameter (CHANGE) is<BR>implied to be ALL unless specified otherwise. It denotes which fields in the<BR>existing items may be changed based on what changes are seen to the item inside<BR>the CMARE file.   The third parameter (ON) is implied to be ALL unless<BR>specified otherwise.  It denotes how an item in the CMARE file is matched with<BR>an existing item in your world.  If the listed fields from the CMARE file and<BR>the existing item are equal, the items will be considered a match for the<BR>purposes of merging.  The fourth parameter (IGNORE) is implied to be NONE<BR>unless specified otherwise.  It denotes exceptions to the (ON) parameter,<BR>namely which fields are allowed to differ between items in the CMARE file and<BR>an existing item in cases where they would otherwise be considered a match<BR>according to the (ON) parameter.  Matched items in your existing world, in<BR>every room, will be modified accordingly, and the room will be resaved to your<BR>database.  The log will reflect all changes made to your world.  Every room in<BR>every area in your world will be reloaded from the database prior to any<BR>evaluations or changes.<BR><BR>When using a database as a source, the merge command will compare and match the<BR>database version of the room contents with the local world.  The user is then<BR>given the opportunity to make changes to the local world depending on<BR>differences. The merge requires DBCLASS, DBSERVICE, DBUSER, and DBPASS<BR>parameters be set.  The IGNORE parameters is a comma delimited list of fields<BR>to ignore when displaying differences.  To mask the types of objects checked,<BR>the user can specify mobs, items, or the whole rooms after the word database,<BR>and a zappermask can be included after the mask parameters.</pre>

			<pre>Quests are defined as a definable tasks which are completed by players for<BR>prizes. These tasks, the monitoring of their completion and status, as well as<BR>their availability, can all be automated by CoffeeMud.<BR><BR>A quest is created using the CREATE QUEST [SCRIPT] command.  Where [SCRIPT] is<BR>a either a complete quest script, where each command line is terminated by a<BR>semicolon (;), or a load command of the form LOAD=[SCRIPT PATH].  An example of<BR>a create script using a load command is as follows: CREATE QUEST<BR>LOAD=/resources/quests/myquest.txt. To load one of the built-in quests, for<BR>instance, use CREATE QUEST LOAD=quests/robbed/robbed.quest.<BR><BR>Quests may be started manually, or by making them autoquests using the SET WAIT<BR>and SET INTERVAL commands below.  Quests may be started manually by using the<BR>MODIFY QUEST [QUEST NAME] command.  Quests can be listed, to see their status,<BR>using the LIST QUESTS command.  Quests can be removed from the list using the<BR>DESTROY QUEST [QUEST NAME] command.  Quests can be saved using the SAVE QUESTS<BR>command.  Quests saved this way will be restored during the next CoffeeMud<BR>reboot. <BR><BR>When creating a new quest using the CREATE QUEST [SCRIPT] command, whether you<BR>use the load command to specify an external script, or include the script<BR>directly into the create command, the quest script commands are as follows:<BR><BR>SET NAME [QUEST NAME] - the *unique* name of your quest. This is a required<BR>command!<BR><BR>SET DURATION [#TICKS] - # of ticks (4 second periods) the quest will last once<BR>started. 0=eternal. This is a required command!<BR><BR>SET WAIT [#TICKS] - minimum # ticks to wait between auto-starts of the quest.<BR>Required for auto-quests only!<BR><BR>SET DATE [#DAY]-[#MONTH] - The real-life start-date of the quest. This is a<BR>valid substitute for the SET WAIT requirement.<BR><BR>SET MUDDAY [#DAY]-[#MONTH] - The start mud-date of the quest, according to the<BR>default global mud calendar. This is a valid substitute for the SET WAIT<BR>requirement.<BR><BR>SET INTERVAL [#TICKS] - random # ticks (1-#TICKS) to wait between auto-starting<BR>the quest, AFTER the WAIT period (see above) is over. Required for auto-quests!<BR><BR>SET MINPLAYERS [#PLAYERS] - Minimum number of players who must be online for a<BR>timed quest to automatically start. See SET PLAYERMASK.<BR><BR>SET PLAYERMASK [MASKSTRING] - If this string is empty or not specified, then<BR>anyone is considered a player for the purposes of the MINPLAYERS setting above.<BR>However, you can specify a "zapper mask" to narrow down the definition of a<BR>player.  See HELP ZAPPERMASKS for the list of valid mask values to put here.<BR><BR>SET RUNLEVEL [#LEVEL] - Normally, a timed quest will always run when its time<BR>comes up.  Setting a value above -1 will prevent this quest from running when<BR>its time comes up if another quest is also running at the same or LOWER run<BR>level.<BR><BR>IMPORT MOBS [XML FILE PATH] - this will import a list of custom mobs from a<BR>.CMARE file generated using the EXPORT ROOM MOBS command. The parameter must be<BR>the path and file name of the file, using the same format as the LOAD= command<BR>mentioned above.  This list can then be accessed with the LOAD MOB, or LOAD<BR>MOBGROUP command.<BR><BR>IMPORT ITEMS [XML FILE PATH] - this will import a list of custom items from a<BR>.CMARE file generated using the EXPORT ROOM ITEMS command. The parameter must<BR>be the path and file name of the file, using the same format as the LOAD=<BR>command mentioned above.  This list can then be accessed with the LOAD ITEM or<BR>LOAD ITEMGROUP command.<BR><BR>SET AREA ([AREA NAME OR NAMES]) - will set the current designated area to the<BR>area specified. Although this does nothing in itself, it is important for the<BR>several commands which load mobs and items. The area name ANY may be given to<BR>choose a random area. Several area names may be specified as choices by setting<BR>the first area name as ANY, followed by your other area name choices, separated<BR>by spaces. If no area name is given, this will CLEAR the area designation. This<BR>can have a profound impact on how subsequent mob or item loading, or room<BR>setting commands work.<BR><BR>SET AREA [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the same<BR>name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below<BR>this command listing.  If the object resolves to a group of objects, a random<BR>one from the group will be chosen.<BR><BR>SET AREAGROUP ([AREA NAME OR NAMES]) - will set the current designated<BR>ROOMGROUP to the areas specified. Although this does nothing in itself, it is<BR>important for the several commands which load mobs and items. The area name ANY<BR>may be given to choose a random area. The area name ALL may be given to choose<BR>all world areas. Several area names may be specified as choices by setting the<BR>first area name as ANY, followed by your other area name choices, separated by<BR>spaces. If no area name is given, this will CLEAR the ROOMGROUP designation.<BR>This can have a profound impact on how subsequent mob or item loading, or room<BR>setting commands work.<BR><BR>SET ROOMGROUP ([ROOM NAME]) - will set the ROOMGROUP to the set specified. If<BR>an area has been previously designated, and not cleared (see SET ROOMGROUP),<BR>then the rooms will be selected from the designated area according to the room<BR>name criteria. Otherwise, rooms from the whole map will be chosen. If a room<BR>name of ANY is given, then the rooms will be chosen randomly from the world, or<BR>the area if designated.  The room name of ALL will choose all rooms.  Several<BR>room names may be specified as choices by setting the first room name as ANY,<BR>followed by your other room name choices, separated by spaces.  If no room name<BR>is given, this will effectly clear the ROOMGROUP designation (but it will not<BR>clear the area designation!).  Valid room names include map room IDs such as<BR>MyArea#123, or key words from the titles or descriptions of rooms.<BR><BR>SET ROOMGROUP [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the<BR>same name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers<BR>below this command listing.<BR><BR>SET ROOM ([ROOM NAME]) - will set the current designated room to the set<BR>specified. If a room or area has been previously designated, and not cleared<BR>(see SET AREA), then the room will be selected from the designated area<BR>according to the room name criteria. Otherwise, a room from the whole map will<BR>be chosen. If a room name of ANY is given, then the room will be chosen<BR>randomly from the world, or the area if designated.  Several room names may be<BR>specified as choices by setting the first room name as ANY, followed by your<BR>other room name choices, separated by spaces.  If no room name is given, this<BR>will effectly clear the room designation (but it will not clear the area<BR>designation!).   Valid room names include map room IDs such as MyArea#123, or<BR>key words from the titles or descriptions of rooms.<BR><BR>SET ROOM [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the same<BR>name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below<BR>this command listing.   If the object resolves to a group of objects, a random<BR>one from the group will be chosen.<BR><BR>SET ROOMGROUPAROUND [#RADIUS] ([ROOM NAME])- will set the ROOMGROUP to the set<BR>of rooms up to RADIUS rooms from the previously set ROOM. The rooms will be<BR>selected from the set of rooms which are up to RADIUS rooms away from the<BR>currently set ROOM (see SET ROOM/SET LOCALE). The radius must then be greater<BR>than 0.  If the following room name of ANY is given, then all rooms in the<BR>radius are grouped.  Several room names may be specified as choices by setting<BR>the first room name as ANY, followed by your other room name choices, separated<BR>by spaces.  If no room name is given, this will effectly clear the ROOMGROUP<BR>designation (but it will not clear the area designation!).     Valid room names<BR>include map room IDs such as MyArea#123, or key words from the titles or<BR>descriptions of rooms.<BR><BR>SET LOCALEGROUP ([LOCALE]) - will set the ROOMGROUP to the ones with the<BR>specified class name. If an area has been previously designated, and not<BR>cleared (see SET AREA), then the rooms will be selected from the designated<BR>area according to the locale criteria. Otherwise, rooms from the whole map will<BR>be chosen. If a locale name of ANY is given, then the rooms will be chosen<BR>randomly from the world, or the area if designated.  Several locale types may<BR>be specified as choices by setting the first locale type as ANY, followed by<BR>your other locale type choices, separated by spaces.  If no locale is given,<BR>this will effectly clear the ROOMGROUP designation (but it will not clear the<BR>area designation!).  Valid locale names may be Locale class names such as<BR>MountainSurface, StdRoom, etc, or they may be locale types such as stone,<BR>wooden, underwater, mountains, etc.<BR><BR>SET LOCALEGROUP [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the<BR>same name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers<BR>below this command listing.<BR><BR>SET LOCALEGROUPAROUND ([#RADIUS] [LOCALE]) - will set the ROOMGROUP to the ones<BR>with the specified class name. The rooms will be selected from the set of rooms<BR>which areup to RADIUS rooms away from the currently set ROOM (see SET<BR>LOCALE/SET ROOM). The radius must then be greater than 0.  If the following<BR>locale name of ANY is given, then all rooms in the radius are grouped.  Several<BR>room names may be specified as choices by setting the first locale name as ANY,<BR>followed by your other locale name choices, separated by spaces.  If no locale<BR>name is given, this will effectly clear the ROOMGROUP designation (but it will<BR>not clear the area designation!).   Valid locale names may be Locale class<BR>names such as MountainSurface, StdRoom, etc, or they may be locale types such<BR>as stone, wooden, underwater, mountains, etc.<BR><BR>SET LOCALE ([LOCALE]) - will set the current designated room to the one with<BR>the specified class name. If a room or area has been previously designated, and<BR>not cleared (see SET AREA), then the room will be selected from the designated<BR>area according to the locale criteria. Otherwise, a room from the whole map<BR>will be chosen. If a locale of ANY is given, then the room will be chosen<BR>randomly from the world, or the area if designated.  Several locale types may<BR>be specified as choices by setting the first locale type as ANY, followed by<BR>your other locale type choices, separated by spaces.  If no locale is given,<BR>this will effectly clear the room designation (but it will not clear the area<BR>designation!).   Valid locale names may be Locale class names such as<BR>MountainSurface, StdRoom, etc, or they may be locale types such as stone,<BR>wooden, underwater, mountains, etc.<BR><BR>SET LOCALE [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the same<BR>name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below<BR>this command listing.   If the object resolves to a group of objects, a random<BR>one from the group will be chosen.<BR><BR>SET MOBGROUP (RESELECT) ([MOB NAME]) - will designate a set of mobs with the<BR>given name. If the name ends with MASK=..., then a mask as described by the<BR>help entry for ZAPPERMASKS will apply in addition to the name mask entered<BR>before the MASK= string.  A mob name of ALL will select all appropriate mobs.<BR>The mobs chosen will be selected from those in the designated ROOMGROUP (if one<BR>is designated),  AREA (if one is designated) or the world. The mobs must exist<BR>somewhere in the map for this command to work.  Normally a mob will not be<BR>placed in the mobgroup if the mob has been previously set with SET MOB, or SET<BR>MOBTYPE.  The RESELECT flag is an optional first flag which, if specified,<BR>designates that  mobs may be placed in the mobgroup even if previously set, so<BR>long as the RESELECT flag was also used in the previous SET MOB or SET MOBTYPE<BR>command.<BR><BR>SET MOBGROUP [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the<BR>same name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers<BR>below this command listing<BR><BR>SET MOB  (RESELECT)  ([MOB NAME]) - will set the current mob to one with the<BR>given mob name. If the name ends with MASK=..., then a mask as described by the<BR>help entry for ZAPPERMASKS will apply in addition to the mob name entered<BR>before the MASK= string. Ths mob chosen will be selected from a MOBGROUP if one<BR>has been set. Otherwise, the mob chosen will be selected from those in the<BR>designated ROOMGROUP (if one is designated), or the AREA (if one is designated)<BR>or finally the world. The mob must exist somewhere one of those groups for this<BR>command to work. If a room has been previously designated, then this command<BR>will bring the chosen mob to that room. If a room or area has not been<BR>designated (or was cleared), then this command will designate a new room and<BR>area.  Normally a mob will not be chosen by this command if the mob has been<BR>previously set with SET MOB, or SET MOBTYPE.  The RESELECT flag is an optional<BR>first flag which, if specified, designates that a mob may be chosen if<BR>previously chosen, so long as the RESELECT flag was also used in the previous<BR>SET MOB or SET MOBTYPE command.<BR><BR>SET MOB [OBJECT] - serves the same purpose as the above command of the same<BR>name, but the argument is an object specifier.  See Object Specifiers below<BR>this command listing.   If the object resolves to a group of objects, a random<BR>one from the group will be chosen.<BR><BR>SET MOBTYPE (RESELECT) ([CLASS]) - will set the current mob to one with the<BR>given class name. Ths mob chosen will be selected from a MOBGROUP if one has<BR>been set. Otherwise, the mob chosen will be selected from those in the<BR>designated ROOMGROUP (if one is designated), AREA (if one is designated) or the<BR>world.

See Object Specifiers below<BR>this command listing.   If the object resolves to a group of objects, a random<BR>one from the group will be chosen.<BR><BR>SET ITEMGROUP (RESELECT)  ([ITEM NAME]) - will designate a set of items with<BR>the given name. If the name ends with MASK=..., then a mask as described by the<BR>help entry for ZAPPERMASKS will apply in addition to the item name entered<BR>before the MASK= string. A mob name of ALL will select all appropriate mobs.<BR>The items chosen will be selected from those in the designated ROOMGROUP (if<BR>one is designated), the AREA (if one is designated) or the world.

This command will also designate the current item to the last one<BR>loaded.<BR><BR>LOAD ITEM [ITEM NAME] - will instantiate an item of the given name from the<BR>list of items imported using the IMPORT ITEMS command above. This item will be<BR>set as the current item. If a room, roomgroup, or area has been previously<BR>designated, then this command will create the item in that room. If a room or<BR>area has not been designated (or was cleared), then this command will designate<BR>a random room and area. <BR><BR>GIVE ITEM - will give the currently designated item (designated using the SET<BR>ITEM, or LOAD ITEM command) to the last designated mob or mobs (designated<BR>using the SET MOB, SET MOBGROUP, LOAD MOBGROUP, or LOAD MOB commands).<BR><BR>GIVE ITEMS - will give all currently designated items (designated using the<BR>SET/LOAD ITEM/ITEMGROUP command) to the last designated mob or mobs (designated<BR>using the SET MOB, SET MOBGROUP, LOAD MOBGROUP, or LOAD MOB commands).<BR><BR>GIVE BEHAVIOR [BEHAVIOR ID] ([PARAMETERS]) - The behavior ID must be a valid<BR>behavior class name. The parameters are any parameters you wish to pass to the<BR>behavior. This command will give the most recently designated mob, item, area,<BR>room or mobgroup (designated using the set or load commands), itemgroup, or<BR>roomgroup the above behavior.  The parameters above are optional, and include<BR>any text that would be valid for the behavior id specified.  The text may also<BR>optionally include embedded references to other quest objects.  See below<BR>Object Specifiers in Parameters below for more information on using this<BR>feature.<BR><BR>GIVE ABILITY [ABILITY ID] ([PARAMETERS]) - The ability ID must be a valid<BR>ability class name. The parameters are any parameters you wish to pass to the<BR>ability. This command will give the currently designated mob, or mobgroup<BR>(designated using the set or load commands) the above ability. The parameters<BR>above are optional, and include any text that would be valid for the ability id<BR>specified.  The text may also optionally include embedded references to other<BR>quest objects.  See below Object Specifiers in Parameters below for more<BR>information on using this feature.<BR><BR>GIVE AFFECT [ABILITY ID] ([PARAMETERS]) - The ability ID must be a valid<BR>ability class name. The parameters are any parameters you wish to pass to the<BR>ability. This command will give the currently designated mob, item, room, area,<BR>or mobgroup (designated using the set or load commands), itemgroup, or<BR>roomgroup the above affect. The parameters above are optional, and include any<BR>text that would be valid for the ability id specified.  The text may also<BR>optionally include embedded references to other quest objects.  See below<BR>Object Specifiers in Parameters below for more information on using this<BR>feature.<BR><BR>GIVE FOLLOWER [MOB NAME] - The mob name is a mob which will be selected from<BR>the list of previously designated mobs (designated using the LOAD MOB, SET MOB,<BR>or SET MOBTYPE commands). This mob will be made into a follower of the mob most<BR>recently designated using the SET MOB, SET MOBTYPE, or LOAD MOB command. This<BR>command does not change the current mob designation, nor does it change the<BR>location of either mob.<BR><BR>TAKE BEHAVIOR [BEHAVIOR ID] - The behavior ID must be a valid behavior class<BR>name. This command will take from the most recently designated mob, item, area,<BR>room or mobgroup (designated using the set or load commands), itemgroup, or<BR>roomgroup the above behavior.<BR><BR>TAKE ABILITY [ABILITY ID] - The ability ID must be a valid ability class name.<BR>This command will take from the currently designated mob, or mobgroup<BR>(designated using the set or load commands) the above ability. The parameters<BR>above are optional, and include any text that would be valid for the ability id<BR>specified.<BR><BR>TAKE AFFECT [ABILITY ID] - The ability ID must be a valid ability class name.<BR>This command will take from the currently designated mob, item, room, area, or<BR>mobgroup (designated using the set or load commands), itemgroup, or roomgroup<BR>the above affect. <BR><BR>RESET- If a ROOM has been designated using SET ROOM, or by any other previously<BR>described method, this command will cause that room to reset, or re-load from<BR>the database.  If a ROOM is not currently set (or has been unset), but a<BR>ROOMGROUP or an AREA has been set, this command will cause all rooms in that<BR>set (respectively) to reload from the database.  Doing either can be somewhat<BR>time consuming, and may disrupt any players in the rooms affected, as it will<BR>cause items to vanish from the floor, and make players and mobs unable to move<BR>until the process is completed.<BR><BR>&lt;SCRIPT> - This designates the beginning of embedded Javascript in your quest<BR>script.  The end is designated by a corresponding &lt;/SCRIPT> tag on its own<BR>line.  See the next section for more details.<BR><BR>LOAD= ([QUEST FILE]) ([ARGUMENT] ... [ARGUMENT])  - This command will cause the<BR>specified external quest script file to be loaded and executed as if it were <BR>embedded at the current point in the script.  The  quest  filename is of the<BR>same format mentioned above.  When LOAD= is used as a command inside a script,<BR>you can also specify one or more space-delimited arguments which will be<BR>accessible inside the target quest script as Object Specifiers.  The first<BR>argument given, whether it is itself an Object Specifier, or a simple string,<BR>will be accessible inside the target quest script as ARG1, the second as ARG2,<BR>and so forth.  A special case exists, however, if one of the arguments<BR>evaluates to an Object Specifier which represents a group of objects (such as<BR>MOBGROUP or ITEMGROUP).  If that case occurs, the LOAD= command will execute<BR>once for every object inside the group! See the discussion of Object Specifiers<BR>and Object Spcifiers in Parameters for more information.<BR><BR>&lt;OPTION> ([QUEST SCRIPT COMMANDS]) &lt;/OPTION> - Putting quest script commands<BR>inside of &lt;OPTION> tags means that, for every execution of the quest script,<BR>only ONE of the &lt;OPTION> tags will be have their script commands executed.  The<BR>one chosen will be selected at random.  If only one &lt;OPTION> tag exists, it<BR>will be chosen every time, of course.<BR><BR>* Note About #.  In a quest script, anywhere the # sign is used above (such as<BR>[#TICKS] or [#PLAYERS], you may enter a normal old every day number (34) or you<BR>may enter a valid arithmetic expression using real or integer numbers and any<BR>of the following operators: + - *  () ?<BR><BR>* Object Specifiers.  Many of the SET ... commands, such as SET MOBGROUP, SET<BR>MOB, SET ITEMGROUP, SET ROOM, etc, have forms which allow you to designate<BR>their value using an [OBJECT] string.  An [OBJECT] string is one of the<BR>following basic quest-script values: "LOADEDMOBS", "LOADEDITEMS", "AREA",<BR>"ROOM", "MOBGROUP", "ITEMGROUP", "ROOMGROUP", "ITEM", "ENVOBJ", "STUFF", "MOB",<BR>or one of the following mystery quest-script values:  "FACTION",<BR>"FACTIONGROUP", "AGENT", "AGENTGROUP", "ACTION", "ACTIONGROUP", "TARGET",<BR>"TARGETGROUP", "MOTIVE", "MOTIVEGROUP", "WHEREHAPPENED", "WHEREHAPPENEDGROUP",<BR>"WHEREAT", "WHEREATGROUP", "WHENHAPPENED", "WHENHAPPENEDGROUP", "WHENAT",<BR>"WHENATGROUP", "TOOL", "TOOLGROUP".  Using the SET command in this way allows<BR>you to either COPY an objects value, or re-designate it for the purposes of one<BR>of the GIVE ... commands.  If the quest script was executed from inside of<BR>another using the LOAD= script command, and arguments were specified from the<BR>above objects, you may also have access to argument object specifiers, such as<BR>ARG1, ARG2, ... ARGN.  There will be one such object specifier available for<BR>each argument passed to the script.  Please note that some object specifiers<BR>return single objects (such as MOB, ITEM, ROOM) and some return collections of<BR>objects (such as ROOMGROUP, MOBGROUP, ITEMGROUP).  Object specifiers can also<BR>be combined using + and - characters.  For instance, MOBGROUP-MOB would return<BR>the group of mobs in the MOBGROUP minus the specified MOB while the specifier<BR>MOB+ITEM would refer to an object group containing both the specified MOB and<BR>the specified ITEM.<BR><BR>* Object Specifiers in Parameters. When specifing parameters for the GIVE<BR>BEHAVIOR, GIVE ABILITY, or GIVE AFFECT command, you may embed the names of one<BR>or more of the Object Specifiers by prefixing the Object Specifier code string<BR>with a $ character, and concluding it with a space or other non-alphanumeric<BR>character.  For instance, the command: "give script GREET_PROG 100; say I love<BR>$MOB!!!;~;" would embed the name string for the MOB object specifier inside the<BR>in-line script.   In addition to this capability, you may also put a special<BR>character after the $ and before the object specifier to manipulate how the<BR>name of the object is generated.  Special characters are: '_' (to make the name<BR>in uppercase), '&' to remove any prefixed english article words from the name,<BR>or '|' to replace all spaces in the name with | characters (which is very<BR>useful for QuestChat parameters).<BR><BR>Mystery Objects in Quest scripts:<BR><BR>In addition to the normal quest objects mentioned above, such as MOB, ITEM,<BR>ROOM and so forth, there are also extranous objects and groups intended for use<BR>when building logic problem mysteries.

			<a name="SECURITY"><B>SECURITY</B></a>
			<pre>SECURITY in CoffeeMud is on a player by player basis.  <BR>SYSOP status is defined as the ultimate security to do anything, anywhere, at<BR>any time.  Access to all commands in all areas will be available.  SYSOP status<BR>is defined in the CoffeeMud ini file entry SYSOPMASK which establishes the<BR>player characteristics that designate SYSOPS. All players who meet the<BR>requirements of the mask are automatically SYSOPS.<BR><BR>Players who are not SYSOPS may also be granted specific privileges.  Each of<BR>the privileges may be limited to specific areas, or available globally.<BR>Privileges are defined in the Security section of a players settings.  Each<BR>security code listed for a player may be either a list of security Groups, or a<BR>specific security code.<BR><BR>Security GROUPS are also defined in the ini file.  A Security GROUP consists of<BR>a group name, and a set of strings or codes representing privileges for that<BR>group.  Each group is prefixed in the INI file with the "GROUP_".  However, you<BR>should not use the "GROUP_" when adding group priviledges to the Security field<BR>of a player.  For instance, if you have "GROUP_BUILDER" defined in the INI<BR>file, then you would add "BUILDER" to Security when modifying a player in order<BR>to make that user part of the BUILDER group.  The security codes which make up<BR>each group are implicitly global, but can be qualified as area-only using the<BR>keyword "AREA".<BR><BR>The following are the default strings or codes which, when found in a players<BR>security settings or in a group definition, confer the listed privileges. Each<BR>of these settings may be entered as listed below, or prefixed with the word<BR>"AREA" followed by a space, followed by the key.  This has the effect of making<BR>that privilege only available in or at areas where the Player is listed in the<BR>areas "Staff" setting.  For example, the security code "ANNOUNCE" by itself<BR>confers the global ability to use the ANNOUNCE command.  The security code<BR>"AREA ANNOUNCE" means that the ANNOUNCE command can only be used inside areas<BR>where the player is listed as Staff.<BR><BR><BR>ABOVELAW=Immunity to the Arrest behavior.<BR>AFTER=The ability to use the command of the same name.<BR>AHELP=The ability to access administrative help files.<BR>ALLSKILLS=This code gives the player access to ALL skills,songs,prayers,spells<BR>at their next login.<BR>ANNOUNCE=The ability to use the command of the same name.<BR>AS=The ability to use the command of the same name.<BR>AT=The ability to use the command of the same name.<BR>BAN=The ability to use the command of the same name, as well as DESTROY BAN,<BR>LIST BAN, and access the BAN MUDGrinder feature.<BR>BEACON=The ability to use the command of the same name.<BR>BOOT=The ability to use the command of the same name.<BR>CHARGEN=The ability to use the command of the same name.<BR>CLOAK=The ability to use the command of the same name, as well as see those who<BR>are cloaked.<BR>CMDAREAS=The ability to Create, Modify, and Destroy areas.

See<BR>help on CMFS or VFS for the difference between the two.<BR><BR>The commands are case-insensitive, except where dealing with the local file<BR>system, where it may be case-sensitive depending upon the host system.  As<BR>mentioned in the CMFS docs, filenames and paths may be preceded by a :: string<BR>to denote forced VFS access, or // to denote forced local file-system access. <BR>When neither is specified for a given shell command, the VFS file is always<BR>preferred. The / character is always used to separate directory paths and<BR>folders, such as /resources/text/down.txt would refer to the file down.txt in<BR>the text folder, which in turn is in the resources folder, which in turn is<BR>located in the root directory.<BR><BR>The shell command may be entered with no parameter to see the players current<BR>directory. When viewing directories, a "-" character will precede a file which<BR>exists only in the VFS system.

			<a name="TATTOO"><B>TATTOO</B></a>
			<pre>Tattoo's are intended to act as miscellaneous flags which players may obtain,<BR>not unlike a quest point.  These tattoo's can then be checked for as<BR>requirements to enter rooms or exits, or to possess certain items.<BR>An example would be like this:  The completion of a specific quest occurs when<BR>Gunther defeats the evil sorcerer Nunder and enters his inner chamber (where<BR>all the treasure is hidden).  Entering this inner chamber automatically grants<BR>Gunther a Tatto called "NUNDERKILLER".  Now, elsewhere in the realm is the<BR>second quest where Nunder's apprentice has escaped with an ancient artifact and<BR>is up to no good.  However, to even ENTER the area where Nunder's apprentice is<BR>operating, the system (via the Prop_ReqTattoo property on this other Area)<BR>requires that Gunther already have the "NUNDERKILLER" Tattoo.  If Gunther had<BR>not defeated Nunder and obtained the "NUNDERKILLER" Tattoo, he would not be<BR>allowed into the realm of Nunder's apprentice.</pre>
